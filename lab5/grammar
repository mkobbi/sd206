In regular grammar, we may only have rules following either the form A -> x or A -> xB (A -> Bx for left-linear grammar). Whereas in context free grammar, rules may be A-> xBy, where xBy can be whatever string of terminals and non terminals.
A regular grammar can be implemented with a finite state automaton as the evaluation of a string depends of one symbol at a time.
On the other hand, that of a context-free grammar depends on the current symbol and the stack generated by the already-read sub-string, which requires a push-down automaton.
