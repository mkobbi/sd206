The issue with the new rule is that it generates an infinite loop.
Let's look at the following subset of rules
np --> det, n.
np --> np, pp.
np --> [kirk].
pp --> np, p.

Our sentence is
Daughter loves her aunt.

The sequences of rules followed would be
s --> np, vp
np --> np, pp
np --> np, pp
...
And so on

QED.
